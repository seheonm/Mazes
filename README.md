Mazes, CS351L Project 3
Hello! Our names are Marina Seheon, Ruby Ta, and Joseph Barela and this is our Mazes for Project 3 in CS351L.

Functionality:
This program generates mazes in 4 different ways, Randomized Depth First Search, Randomized Kruskal’s, Randomized Prim’s, and Aldous-Broder. It also solves the mazes that were generated in 4 different ways, Random Mouse, Wall Follower, Tremaux, and Lightning.
Joseph implemented maze generator algorithms. Ruby worked on the Wall Follower and Lightning solving algorithms. Marina worked on the Tremaux solving algorithm, version control, solver and genertor factories. We all worked on the GUI aspects and we would meet up frequently to work on code together. Our porgram has both the command line and GUI for the mazes. Just input the text file with the window size, cell cize, generator algorithm, and solving algroithm. Here is an example of the format of the text file:
900
10
kruskal
tremaux

Extra Credit:
We made our program astically pleasing.

Possible bugs:
//Add when done
